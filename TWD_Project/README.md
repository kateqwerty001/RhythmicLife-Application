# RhythmicLife: Tune into Your Day 

This App is our project for Data Visualization Techniques course at our studies. Our task was to create an interactive visualization - a dashboard. We have decided to create the visualization of our streaming data from Spotify connected with our daily lives. For this purpose, we have made a request for our datasets from Spotify. In order to create the dashboard, we have used also Spotify Web API which returns metadata about music artists, albums and tracks, directly from the Spotify Data Catalogue.
